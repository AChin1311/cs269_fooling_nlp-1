of particularly successful memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction by believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer <b

famous scientist is only human she may be an expert <b style='color:red'>an2r70v</b> some fields but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight many respected scientists <b style='color:red'>1de076v5</b> made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing <b style='color:red'>0005111312</b> entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread <b style='color:red'>dip</b> far the theory <b style='color:red'>tm9v</b> talks of memes sets of ideas which can themselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction by believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer <b style='color:red'>3hm</b> to keep one time believers from admitting that they were mistaken some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes of course in the view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme religion is not a <b style='color:red'>fraud</b> thing because <b style='color:red'>d2'5</b> the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the <b style='color:red'>d2dk</b> messages of atheism there are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just a few of them don't be surprised to see ideas which <b style='color:red'>285w0'</b> also present in some religions there is more <b style='color:red'>meaddata</b> moral behaviour than following <b style='color:red'>0205</b> be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it's up to you to <b style='color:red'>sensitivity</b> it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it's probably the only one you'll have it's no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself <b style='color:red'>3399</b> because popular doesn't mean it's good if you must assume something assume something it's easy to test don't believe things just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly all beliefs should be open to question thanks for taking the time to read this article mathew begin pgp signature
